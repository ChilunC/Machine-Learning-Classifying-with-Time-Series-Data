# Machine-Learning-Classifying-with-Time-Series-Data
This Code Examines Time Series data and classifies it. It is for small datasets. It was developed on a leg deformity classification data set. Each code generates a plot graphing the top two key points of measure and color coding the classification.

## PreProcessing

The time series needs a distance measure from a baseline time series to quantify a measure of distance.
